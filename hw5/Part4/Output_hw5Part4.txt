The server I used has 40 threads, I set the number of elements in workQ n = 1,000,000.

Parallel construct, omp_set_num_threads(40):
execution time: 0.015744s

Sequential construct, omp_set_num_threads(1):
execution time: 0.004705s

The sequential is faster because the scheduling and thread set-up take fairly good amount of time.
